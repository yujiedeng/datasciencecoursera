## R Markdown

### Overview
The purpose of the project is to practice on collecting, working with, and cleaning a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
A full description of the data used in this project can be found at 'The UCI Machine Learning Repository'(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

###Project Goals
The goal of the project is to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
    5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
